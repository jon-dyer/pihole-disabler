Thingerthing to temporarily disable blocking on pihole.

set api base to PIHOLE_BASE_URL environment variable. example: https://pi.hole/api
set your pihole password to PIHOLE_PASS environment variable.
someday will add a timer env variable probably, is a tiny change but I'm going to bed. currently hardcoded 2min.
